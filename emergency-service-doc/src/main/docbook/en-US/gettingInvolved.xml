        <para>
            As in every community effort we need your feedback about the features that we are providing in the project. 
            We are open to suggestions and we are willing to help people that is interested in using and testing the Emergency Service 
            Application. We are also available to train people that wants to get involved with the project and contribute with 
            patches, tests, documentation, new modules and utilities. We can help you to get involved and introduce you to different 
            topics that can be developed for the Emergency Service initiative.

            We are working to provide as much material as we can to encourage people to learn &amp; teach about the 
            concepts implemented inside this application. This is not just about jBPM5 &amp; Drools, is about sharing 
            common architectural patterns and a complete use case that help people to understand the declarative power of 
            rules, processes and complex event processing in a real life infrastructure.
